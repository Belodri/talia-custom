# Structure
- Each feature branch appends its entries to this file under the appropriate category.
- Prefix each entry with one of the following tags: `add:`, `change:`, `remove:`, or `fix:` to specify the type of change.
- In case of merge conflicts, **retain all entries** to ensure no changes are lost.
- During release preparation, entries from this file are reviewed, organized, and moved into the main `changelog.md`.
# Drafts

- fix: Errors with 'dead' status effect and 'Mark NPC Defeated' macro [#263](https://github.com/Belodri/talia-custom/issues/263)
